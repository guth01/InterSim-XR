            # Section 1: General Introduction (2 questions)
            # Question 1: Introduction
            "Hi! I'm Sarah Johnson, a passionate data scientist with 4 years of experience in machine learning and analytics. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from MIT and I'm excited about this role because it combines my love for data with the opportunity to work on impactful AI projects that can drive business decisions.",
            
            # Question 2: Motivation for position
            "I'm attracted to this position because your company is at the forefront of AI innovation in healthcare. I've been following your recent work on predictive diagnostics and I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to apply machine learning to improve patient outcomes. Your commitment to ethical AI aligns perfectly with my values and career goals.",
            
            # Section 2: Technical & Role-based (3 questions)
            # Question 3: Technical knowledge
            "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for prediction or classification, like spam detection with labeled emails. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, such as customer segmentation using clustering. For customer churn prediction, I'd use supervised learning with features like usage patterns, payment history, and demographics, training on historical churn data to predict future churn probability.",
            
            # Question 4: Problem-solving approach
            "When I encounter a new technical problem, I follow a systematic approach. First, I break down the problem into smaller components and research existing solutions. I prototype different approaches using small datasets to validate assumptions. I collaborate with domain experts and use A/B testing when possible. For example, when building a recommendation system, I tested collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid approaches before selecting the best performer.",
            
            # Question 5: Technical tools
            "I'm most comfortable with Python for data science, particularly pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for traditional ML, and TensorFlow for deep learning. I use SQL extensively for data extraction from PostgreSQL and BigQuery. For visualization, I prefer Plotly and Tableau. I also work with cloud platforms like AWS and use Docker for model deployment. I choose Python because of its extensive ecosystem and strong community support.",
            
            # Section 3: Resume & Experience (3 questions)  
            # Question 6: Significant achievement
            "My most significant achievement was leading a customer churn prediction project for a telecom company. The main challenge was dealing with highly imbalanced data where only 3% of customers actually churned. I implemented SMOTE for data balancing, engineered 15 new features including customer lifetime value and usage patterns, and used ensemble methods combining XGBoost with Random Forest. We achieved an F1 score of 0.78 and reduced churn by 12%, saving the company $2M annually.",
            
            # Question 7: Challenging project
            "I worked on a real-time fraud detection system that needed to process 50,000 transactions per minute with sub-100ms latency. The challenge was balancing accuracy with speed while minimizing false positives. I designed a two-stage system using lightweight feature engineering and gradient boosting for initial scoring, followed by deep learning for complex cases. We reduced fraud losses by 35% while maintaining customer satisfaction.",
            
            # Question 8: Career preparation
            "My progression from junior analyst to senior data scientist has been deliberate. I started with exploratory data analysis and basic modeling, then moved to end-to-end ML pipeline development. I gained cloud computing experience, learned MLOps practices, and developed leadership skills by mentoring junior team members. Each role built upon the previous, giving me both technical depth and business acumen essential for this senior position.",
            
            # Section 4: Behavioral Assessment (3 questions)
            # Question 9: Working under pressure/deadlines
            "Last quarter, we had a critical deadline to deploy a pricing optimization model before Black Friday. With only 2 weeks left, I organized daily standups, broke the work into parallel streams, and coordinated with engineering for faster deployment. I worked extra hours for model validation and created automated testing pipelines. We delivered on time and the model increased revenue by 8% during the sales period.",
            
            # Question 10: Learning new technology  
            "Last year, I had to quickly learn Apache Spark for a real-time analytics project processing 10 million events daily. I dedicated evenings to studying the documentation, completed DataBricks courses, and built practice projects with sample datasets. I paired with a senior engineer for hands-on learning and joined Spark community forums. Within 3 weeks, I was able to optimize our ETL pipeline and reduce processing time by 60%.",
            
            # Question 11: Industry challenges/staying current
            "I believe the biggest challenges in data science today are ensuring ethical AI and addressing bias in machine learning models. There's also the challenge of model interpretability, especially with deep learning. I stay current by reading research papers from conferences like NeurIPS and ICML, attending virtual webinars, participating in Kaggle competitions, and contributing to open-source projects. I also follow thought leaders on LinkedIn and subscribe to newsletters like The Batch from deeplearning.ai."
